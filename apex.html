        <h1>What is Apex Legends?:</h1>
        <p> Since 2019, Apex Legends rose to popularity quickly in the video game world. A big part of its success was the free to play aspect. At the time, its communication system was like no other in the battle royale genre. The ability to respawn fallen teammates made the gameplay much more interesting and intense. The fast pace in mobility and gunplay makes Apex Legends a one of a kind game.</p>

        <h1>
         <p> So Why Play It?: </p> 
         </h1>
         <p> This game was perfect especially for energetic me who loved the rush of adrenaline this game gives when in the most competitive scenarios. The fact that the time to eliminate an enemy takes longer than most games create a bigger skill gap that leads to more satisfaction. I also cannot forget how every character has  different abilities and they all can be fun to use."</p>
